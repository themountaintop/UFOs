# UFO Sightings Data Search

## Project Overview

This project was created to give users a way to search through specific data for UFO sightings using specific criteria. I used a combination of HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create the webpage. The user can search for a specific city, state, country, UFO shape, and also for specific dates. The data available for filtering is limited at the moment.

## Results

In order to search the webpage, the user can enter specific criteria. In this first example, the user has searched for a specific date:

In this next image, we can see the user has further filtered down the specific date filter with the city filter to get the exact UFO sighting and the data that goes with it:

If the user searches for something that is not present in the data, they are given no data:

The user also has the ability to filter by specific shapes:

All filters can be used simultaneously as well, and will get the appropriate data given that each filter meets the correct criteria for that data.

## Summary

The site allows for a user(s) to filter through results of UFO sightings to either browse or search for a specific instance. A drawback of the current design is the amount of information available. Another drawback is there is no list or legend available to the user(s) to know what data is present and which is not (cities, states, countries, etc.). In order to address this, I could add a drop down instead of text filtering so that the user(s) can pick from the available data without having to guess what information may or may not be present. Another suggestion would be to add a way to update the data available on a regular basis so that the user(s) always have the most recent information instead of this small dataset.
